Today, we often build deep learning models with PyTorch and TensorFlow. However, it is hard to understand how these frameworks works run our python scripts on GPUs. In this section, we will learn how to profile and write efficient CUDA programs for deep learning. 

The reference lectures are [CUDA-Mode lectures](https://github.com/cuda-mode/lectures) and [awesomeMLSys](https://github.com/cuda-mode/awesomeMLSys).
