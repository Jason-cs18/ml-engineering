When ML engineers start a new project, they often need to build a fast demo to present the key idea. Fortunately, many popular model zoos provide a convenient tool to complete this work.

> If you need to find a specific model zoo of vision (e.g., object detection, pose estimation, etc), I recommend you checkout the model zoo of [OpenMMLab](https://platform.openmmlab.com/modelzoo/), which consists of [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation), [MMagic](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmagic), [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), [MMOCR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr), [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose), [MMAction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2) popular libraries. Also, it provides a series deployment toolbox (e.g., [MMDeploy](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdeploy) and [MMRazor](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrazor)) to accelerate model inference speed. 

## Use HuggingFace to build a demo

## Use ModelScope to build a demo

## Use MMDetection to build a demo

## Conclusion
In this page, we have learned how to build a fast demo for image object detection with three popular model zoos (HuggingFace, ModelScope, and MMDetection). In the [next blog](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/web_demo.html), we will write a interactive webUI for this demo.
