After training a model on a server, you may want to deploy it on a mobile device. However, mobile devices have limited resources and non-GPU hardware. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the pre-trained model to mobile format (minimal model size and mobile backend). 

In this tutoral, we will guide you deploy a vision transformer model on Huawei Mate 30 via [MNN](https://www.mnn.zone/m/0.3/). MNN is developed by Alibaba and it supports on-device training/inference.
