In the previous blog, we have used Ray Train to fine-tune a DETR model. However, training is not easy for some challenging datasets. We need to tune hyperparameters to get the best performance. In this blog, we will learn how to tune hyperparameters with Ray Tune. Full code can be found [here]().

## Tune hyperparameters with Ray Tune (TBD)

## Conclusion
In this blog, we have learned use naive Ray Tune to search the optim hyperparameters for DETR on CPPE-5 dataset.
