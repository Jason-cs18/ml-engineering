## Background
To catch up the latest progress of efficient LLMs, I highly recommend [the introduction course (TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing)](https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2023-fall-65940) from MIT Song Lab.

### Transformer Math
Before we dive into the efficient LLMs, let's review some math behind transformers. It refers to two popular tech blogs ([Transformer Math 101](https://blog.eleuther.ai/transformer-math/) and [Transformer Inference Arithmetic](https://kipp.ly/transformer-inference-arithmetic/)).


## Survey
- [arXiv 2023.02] [Full Stack Optimization of Transformer Inference: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14017), UC Berkeley
  - A new full-stack optimization hardware for transformer models.
  - Arithmetic intensity is a key metric to evaluate the efficiency of the DNN models.

## Efficient LLM Serving
LLM pipeline (stages), cost estimation, metrics.

### Serving LLMs over Heterogeneous Environment

_As AWS reported, 90% of the machine learning demand in the cloud is for inference._

_Key challenges: KV-cache management for long-texts and sparse computation of MoE architectures_

Pipelining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05022), University of Virginia

- [ACL 2023 Demo] [Petals: Collaborative Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.54/), HSE University
  - An implementation of naive model pipeline parallelisms across heterogeneous devices. 

- [arXiv 2024.04] [MÂ´elange: Cost Efficient Large Language Model Serving by
Exploiting GPU Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14527), UC Berkeley
  - A cost-efficient GPU allocation stategy for LLM serving (model request size, request rate, and latency service-level objective).

- [MLSys 2024] [HeteGen: Heterogeneous Parallel Inference for Large Language Models on Resource-Constrained Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01164), National University of Singapore
  - A I/O aware parallel strategy for on-device LLM serving.

- [ICML 2024] [HEXGEN: Generative Inference of Large Language Model
over Heterogeneous Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11514), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and ETH Zurich
    - Without a careful model partition strategy, naive pipeline and tensor parallelism lead to out-of-memory errors.
    - An [implementation](https://github.com/Relaxed-System-Lab/HexGen) that accommodates tensor model parallelism and pipeline parallelism. 

### Datasets

## Efficient LLM Training
The standard LLM training phrase contains three stages: pre-train, fine-tune, and alignment.

- Pre-train aims to learn a common knowledge from a large-scale corpus (~20P tokens, P is the number of parameters).
- Fine-tune targets to improve task-related capability on instruction dataset, such as machine translation (~1%-5% pre-train data).
- Alignment aims to tune the trained model with human perference. It makes LLMs output more responsible and consistent answers.
