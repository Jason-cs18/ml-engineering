## Building WebUI with Gradio

## Building WebUI with Streamlit

## Conclusion
In this blog, we have learned to build a simple webUI for the object detection model. Usually, Gradio provides more UI components and Streamlit supports more customization. Thus, we recommend using Gradio to build a simple webUI and Streamlit for more complex webUI.
