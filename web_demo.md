After we got a demo script to run object detection model, we need to build a interactive webUI for this. In this blog, we introduce two popular libraries to build webUI.


> object detection demo has been introduced in [this blog](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/model_selection.html)


## Building WebUI with Gradio

## Building WebUI with Streamlit

## Conclusion
In this blog, we have learned to build a simple webUI for the object detection model. Usually, Gradio provides more UI components and Streamlit supports more customization. Thus, we recommend using Gradio to build a simple webUI and Streamlit for more complex webUI.
