Sustainable AI targets to adapt on new data/task/domain within low energy cost. It contains many similar and hot sub-topics of AI, such as:

- **[Continuous Learning Algorithms and Systems](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/cl_research.html)**: Adapt to new data/task/domain without forgetting.
- **[Collaborative Learning Algorithms and Systems (TBD)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/collaborative_learning.html)**: Adapt to new data/task/domain via collaboration.
- **[Efficient Training and Transfer Algorithms](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/efficientml.html)**: Adapt to new data/task/domain fast and easily.
