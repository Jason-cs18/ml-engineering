PyTorch provides a flexible and simple component for AI researchers and engineers to build and train their models. However, its dynamic nature makes it challenging to deploy in production. Specifically, PyTorch models often need a large memory footprint and hava a slow inference speed.

To push its limit on inference, we usually convert them to a static graph and using inference engines to optimize the graph, such as ONNX, TensorRT, and TensorFlow Lite.
