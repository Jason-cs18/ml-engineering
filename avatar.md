## Research Topics

### 2D Talking-Head Synthesis
- GAN-based Talking-Head Synthesis
  - [A Lip Sync Expert Is All You Need for Speech to Lip Generation In the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10010). **MM 2020**. [[<ins>Code</ins>](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip)]
    - _Pre-train a lip-sync expert and use it make GAN generate more lip-sync videos. However, the output shape is `96x96` and can not meet real-world needs._
