Data-centric AI aims to build better models and high-quality datasets simultaneously. Unlike model-centric AI, it highlights the importance of data quality and diversity in improving the performance of machine learning models. Especially on some domains (e.g., medicial and law), labeled data is expensive and hard to obtain. Therefore, we have integrated with a lot of weak/semi-/self-supervised learning techniques to improve the training data and model performance.
