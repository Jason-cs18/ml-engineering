Large language models (LLMs) have attracted many interests of academy and industry. They utilize a simple and unified task (next word prediction) to empower all downstreming tasks in NLP. Recently, they have been validated effectively on vison and other modals. Thus, LLMs are seen as a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
