Hi, this is Yan Lu. I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog. Besides, I'm a system researcher on sustainable AI systems at New York University. 

In the blog, I categorize my notes on the following topics:

- [Machine Learning Engineering (frameworks and coding)]()
  - [Model Selection (a quick demo)]()
  - [Interactive UI (frontend for machine learning models)]()
  - [Web Backend (API route, rate limit, database)]()
  - [Inference Engine (fast serving)]()
  - [Scalable Training Pipeline (distributed training)]()
  - [Hyperparameter Optimization (tuning)]()
  - [Monitor, Debug, Log, Test]() 
- [Deep Learning Basics (models and learning approaches)]()
  - [Transformers in NLP and Vision]()
  - [CLIP and Its Variants]()
  - [Contrastive Learning in NLP and Vision]()
- [Research Advances on Sustainable AI]()
  - [Continuous Learning (adapt to new data)]()
  - [Efficient Learning (cost-efficient traing)]()
  - [Ensemble Learning (robust learning)]()
  - [Efficient Inference (cost-efficient inference)]()

Here is my [personal homepage](https://jason-cs18.github.io/).
