Hi, this is Yan Lu. I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog. Besides, I'm a system researcher on sustainable AI systems at New York University. 

In the blog, I categorize my notes on the following topics:

- [Machine Learning Engineering (workflow)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/ml_engineer.html)
  - [Model Selection (a quick demo)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/model_selection.html)
  - [Interactive UI (frontend for machine learning models)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/web_demo.html)
  - [Web Backend (API route, rate limit, database)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/fastapi.html)
  - [Manage AI Service with Container (docker, docker-compose)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/docker.html)
  - [Inference Engine (fast serving)](https://jason-cs18.github.io/ml-engineering/inference_engine.html)
